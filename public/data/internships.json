    "description" : "<h1>THE CODEGURUKUL INTERNSHIP ADVANTAGE</h1>\n                <p>This Internship is organized by Codegurukul, to train and mentor the best students in Mumbai. The program is a one month internship conducted by experienced faculty. Students will be trained on the latest web technologies that power the most popular websites like LinkedIn, Facebook and eBay. Each student will be able to set up their own web application at the end of the course and will also be offered an option to opt in for more advanced topics over the course of this internship.</p>\n<h3>Week One:</h3>\n                <p>The first week will be a Foundation Course in which the basics of website development like front end development and version control will be covered. Students will also work on a project which will be based on what they learn in the week. The course is designed with the assumption that the student has no prior knowledge of the subject. The refresher course on HTML5, CSS3 and Javascript will get your creative juices flowing! Ignite the designer in you!</p>\n<h3>Week Two:</h3>\n                <p>The second week will feature topics backend development, deployment and optimization. Students will be trained on node.js, mongoDB and other technologies. Optional add-on paid courses may be offered in the second week. These courses will be focused towards leveraging the basic technologies learnt during the first week and will cover some advanced topics. They will in no way affect the certification of the internship.</p>\n <h3>Week Three and Four:</h3>\n                <p>Week three and four would consist of on-site project development where a student would work on a particular project from his/her preferred location. Project contribution would be monitored using Github.</p>",
